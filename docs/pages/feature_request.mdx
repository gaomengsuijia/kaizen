# Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests from our users, as they help us improve our product and provide a better experience for everyone. If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please follow the steps below to submit a feature request.

## Step 1: Check Existing Requests

Before creating a new feature request, we recommend checking the existing ones in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen/discussions) to see if your idea has already been suggested. If you find a similar request, you can upvote it or add your thoughts to the existing discussion.

## Step 2: Create a New Discussion

If your feature request is unique, you can create a new discussion by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen/discussions) page for our repository.
2. Click on the "New Discussion" button.
3. Select the "Feature Request" category from the dropdown menu.
4. Provide a clear and descriptive title for your feature request.
5. In the discussion body, provide a detailed description of your proposed feature or enhancement. Include the following information:
   - A brief overview of the feature
   - The problem it solves or the benefit it provides
   - Any relevant use cases or scenarios
   - Mockups, diagrams, or examples (if applicable)
   - Any additional context or information that could be helpful

## Step 3: Engage with the Community

Once you've created your feature request, others in the community can view, comment, and react to it. We encourage you to engage with the community, answer questions, and provide additional details or clarifications as needed.

## Step 4: Wait for Review and Feedback

Our team regularly reviews the feature requests in the discussions. We may ask for additional information, provide feedback, or share our plans regarding the implementation of the feature. Please be patient, as we carefully evaluate each request and prioritize them based on various factors.

## Step 5: Stay Informed

We will update the discussion with any progress or decisions made regarding your feature request. If your request is accepted for implementation, we will provide updates on the development timeline and release plans.
