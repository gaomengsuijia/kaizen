# Work Summary Generator

The Work Summary Generator is a tool that creates easy-to-understand summaries of code changes for non-technical stakeholders and founders.

### How it works:
1. Provide a Git diff representing the code changes to be summarized.
2. The tool uses advanced language models to analyze the diff and generate a detailed summary.
3. The summary includes a high-level overview, sectional breakdown, plain language explanations, feature highlights, impact analysis, and visual aids.
4. The tool ensures a consistent, readable structure.
