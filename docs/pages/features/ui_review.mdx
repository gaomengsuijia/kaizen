## UI Reviewer

The UI Reviewer feature is powered by kaizen and provides feedback to improve the user experience and accessibility of UI components.

### How it Works:
- Input the HTML code of your UI components.
- The UI Reviewer leverages advanced language models to analyze the code and generate actionable feedback organized in a JSON format.

You can find an example [here](https://github.com/Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen/tree/main/examples/ui_review)

### Using the UI Reviewer:
- Gather and input the HTML code of the UI components you want to review.
- Trigger the UI Reviewer to receive organized feedback.
- Implement the suggested solutions to enhance user experience and accessibility.

### Benefits:
- Improved User Experience
- Accessibility Compliance
- Streamlined Review Process
- Continuous Improvement

### Limitations:
- AI Limitations: Understanding complex UI patterns or context-specific nuances.
- Human Oversight: AI feedback should complement human review and testing.

The UI Reviewer uses AI to enhance the user experience and accessibility of UI components and fosters continuous improvement in your development workflow.
